A simple mobile app to help in cooking, built using [React Native](). This app can help you search millions of recipes from around the world from its database. This app  can also help you do nutritional analysis on your favourite recipes or its ingredients. 

## :slightly_smiling_face: Motivation
This is my first journey into the world of building mobile apps. I have always been a javascript engineer for the web since the start of my career. I've always loved javascript. Technologies like [NodeJS](), [ReactJS](), and [MarkoJS]() have piqued my interest in JS world. Similarly React Native caught my eye, way back, but I couldn't get my hands-on it. However, I decided to make my time and learn it by building an app for myself. I chose [Edamam]() API to serve as the back-end for this app.
